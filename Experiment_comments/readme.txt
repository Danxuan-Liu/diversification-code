Original dataset:

Now the file "data" and "Comments" are empty.

Operate dataset:
step 0: Download the file "CommentsApril2017.csv" online and put it in file "Comments".

step 1: Run count.py to generate the 50_id.txt which contains the information of (id comments_num), and we only need top 50 lines of "50_id.txt".

step 2: Run operate.py to operate the comment data.

step 3: After step 2, you can get 50 instances in file "data".
